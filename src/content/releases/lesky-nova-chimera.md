  Destroyed landscape. Loneliness. Hope.
  A man, alone in front of a post-apocalyptic world that suffered from the anger of men, tries to find his path through this heavy silence and emptiness. It comes to his mind to create a chimera, a hybrid organism, to accompany him in this new chapter. But creating a life has a price. After a time, the chimera start going off the rails… and so it begins. 
  Enter the madness of a man who plays with nature and science…
  Discover the epic and relentless darkpsy sci-fi tale by Lesky.
