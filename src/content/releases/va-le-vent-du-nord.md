artist: Various artists
kind: compilation
date: 2026-02-17
storytelling: |
  This is a tale of the Wind and our humble tribute to the North, to the beauty of its lands, to the magic of its legends and mysteries, and to the wide influence it had over the shaping of the music we love and that is today known as Forest Trance.

  It is a place for bold visions, experimentation, and unconstrained creativity in dance music.

  For the occasion our crew was joined by good friends and guests of honor, all wizards of great talent who went and crafted these nine fine pieces of sonic poetry.
  We send heartfelt thanks to all of you !

  We spared no effort in building this release and we hope you will enjoy it.
  It comes as a beautiful CD packaged with exclusive shiny stickers !
