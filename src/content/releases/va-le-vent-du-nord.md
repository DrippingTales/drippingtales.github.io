  In ages beyond remembering, each year when the nights grew longer and the snow clothed the land in white, the Assembly of Mages would gather at the uttermost edge of the world, where birds fall silent, where the night is eternal, and where no mortal soul ever dares set foot.

  There, they descended into the Cavern of Creation and kindled a magical fire that burned unceasingly for three full moons. Around its shimmering light, they bent in study, deciphering the sacred grimoires concealing the secrets of the birth of all things, and the laws that bind the universe. There, together they wrought a Spell of might unrivaled by any before or since.

  At the time of the equinox the Spell was cast, and carried upon the North wind it swarmed to the four corners of the Earth, bewitching all humans, beasts and growing things alike. All were then drawn into a wondrous trance, wherein they feasted and danced as one throughout the whole summer’s length.

  Nowadays the mages are not to be seen anymore. Yet the seeds they sowed have taken root, and many a tale is still told of the fates of young souls who set sail in search of the secret grimoires of old. It is said that to those who open their hearts and senses, the scent of magic can still be felt in the air; and that on certain summer nights, near towns skirting the darkest woods, the trunks of the trees may still be heard, trembling to the frenzied rhythms of hidden gatherings beneath the stars…
