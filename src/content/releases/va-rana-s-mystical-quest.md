  For this first release, the story will evolves around Rana, a hybrid female lifeform coming from a distant cosmic land, deciding to go on the quest for the Zacatechichi. This very precious medicinal plant is known for its magical properties which makes it extremely valuable. 
  The compilation will contain 4 chapters, and each of them will correspond to a particular stage of the adventure with a particular batch of psychedelic music. Through the presentation of a wide range of Dark/Forest styles from slow bpm to high bpm, Rana’s adventure will evolve accordingly. Between each chapter, there are short transitions told by a magical storyteller to help the listener re-situate himself and add a contextual dimension. 
  Welcome to the Rana's Mystical Quest, let's immerse ourselves…
