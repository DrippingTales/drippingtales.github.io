storytelling: |
  This second release tells the story of a character coming out from a deep forest, arriving in a mysterious area devoided of trees, where the air is cold… and with a huge and infinite maze rising in front of him. He knows he has to enter the maze and find its own way to get out of this empty place, to go back to the mossy and welcoming forest, overflowing with life.
  With this compilation, you will follow the evolution of the character into the depths of the maze. But, is it real, or is it just happening in your mind…?
